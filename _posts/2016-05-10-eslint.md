# Introduction

I know that there are tones of tutorials on how to do this; but it happens that i have my own opinion on how to setup and here it is.
Also, I assume that nodejs and npm are installed and ready to role.
You can get the whole project ready to clone from [github](https://github.com/michaelthe/react-boilerplate).


# Useful commands

``` bash
# build the project
webpack

# watch for changes and build 
webpack --watch

# dev server startup
webpack-dev-server --progress --colors 
```

# Setting up for development 

First lets install the tools we need.
This will make them available though command line.

``` bash

npm install -g eslint

 npm install --save-dev eslint eslint-plugin-react


```
