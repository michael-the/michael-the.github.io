Hello everybody! 

My name is Michael theodorides. You can check some stuff about me [here](/about "about").
What you can expect to find here is anything related to web engineering and what not.
Mainly staff that interest me and, well, it happens that i'm interested in modern hipsterity floating around.

* SQL and noSQL databases 
* RESTful APIs 
* modeJs
* ES6 babel webpack 
* reactJs
* sockets
* cloud 
* functional programing 
* data structures 
* etc

So i will try to log my attempts and problems I encounter while working with those technologies; and, hopefully that will be interesting and educational.

Mike.
